## Idea
In this project, I create a simple social card which looks similar to Twitter post. I splitted up the App to 4 components: Layout, Post, PostContent and UserInfo. The projects allows me to practice the concept of components, passing props, and display a little dynamic content on JSX.
This is the look of the social card after all the works done:
